# E-Commerce Data Science Project

## Overview
This project analyzes e-commerce transaction data to derive meaningful insights, build a lookalike model for customer similarity, and perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques. The aim is to help businesses understand customer behavior and optimize their marketing strategies.

## Key Features

- 🔍 *Detailed transaction dataset analysis*
- 🤝 *Customer similarity prediction model*
- 📊 *Advanced clustering techniques*
- 💡 *Actionable business insights generation*

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following files:

- *Customers.csv*: Contains customer details such as:
  - Demographic information (age, gender, location)
  - Purchase history and frequency

- *Products.csv*: Contains product details such as:
  - Product IDs
  - Descriptions
  - Prices and categories

- *Transactions.csv*: Contains transaction data such as:
  - Customer-product interactions
  - Purchase timestamps and quantities

*Preprocessing steps* include handling missing values, normalizing data, and converting categorical variables into numerical formats where necessary.

## Methodology

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted to understand data distribution, patterns, and anomalies.
- Key techniques include:
  - Visualizing transaction trends over time.
  - Analyzing product popularity by categories.
  - Identifying top-performing customer segments.
  
### Lookalike Model
- Built using *Cosine Similarity* to identify customers who share similar behaviors or purchase patterns.
- Top 3 similar customers with similarity scores are provided for CustomerIDs C0001–C0020.

### Customer Segmentation
- Applied *K-Means Clustering* to group customers based on their purchase behavior.
- The optimal number of clusters was determined using metrics such as the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.
- Clustering results were visualized to aid business decision-making.

## Metrics

To evaluate the models and analysis, the following metrics were used:

- *Davies-Bouldin Index*: Measures clustering quality by comparing intra-cluster distances to inter-cluster distances.
- *Silhouette Score*: Assesses the compactness and separation of clusters.
- *Revenue Analysis*: Helps identify high-value customers and popular products.
- *Customer Acquisition Insights*: Assists in understanding and optimizing customer retention.
