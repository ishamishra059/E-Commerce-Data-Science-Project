## Project Structure

This project is organized into the following structure:

plaintext
ecommerce-data-science/
│
├── data/
│   ├── Customers.csv          # Contains customer details (e.g., demographics, purchase history)
│   ├── Products.csv           # Contains product details (e.g., product IDs, descriptions, prices)
│   └── Transactions.csv       # Contains transaction data (e.g., customer-product interactions)
│
├── notebooks/
│   ├── EDA.ipynb              # Exploratory Data Analysis to understand data patterns
│   ├── Lookalike_Model.ipynb  # Notebook for creating lookalike models to find similar customers
│   └── Customer_Clustering.ipynb  # Customer segmentation using clustering techniques


Each folder and file serves the following purpose:

- *data/*: Stores all datasets used for analysis and modeling.
- *notebooks/*: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, modeling, and insights generation.
